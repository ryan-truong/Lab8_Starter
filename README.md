# Lab 8 - Starter

## Check Your Understanding Questions

## Intro Question
### 1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Everytime code is pushed, it would be best to check it for our automated tests before we actually merge the code to our actual code base.

## Expose
### 2) No, end to end testing tests the user facing side and the flow the user would go through as they navigate through the application. This is different compared to testing the functions that were written.

### 3) No, since a message feature is geared towards the user facing side, it would be more important to test user flow and functionality through end to end testing to see if it works.

### 4) Yes, since we are testing the correctness of a function and checking to see if it's working correctly, we can use unit testing.
